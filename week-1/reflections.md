# Think About Time


I was especially interested in learning about methods of creating new habits and the counter-intuitive ways of increasing productivity. As a right brained individual GTD and other methods of increasing productivity have never really spoken to me, so the habits and counter-intuitive methods were interesting to learn about. Timeboxing is an approach to working on a project that argues that you set a strict time limit (like the pomodoro technique) and then you simply stop wether you deem the project complete or not at that point. I think the idea would then be to reflect upon the experience to improve the next attempt. Like,"Did I finish?," or, "What did I learn about planning (or distractions, or whatever) from this instance of timeboxing?"

I feel like these resources were perfect for me to take an interest in because I freely admit that one of my greatest obstacles is a tendency to shirk organizational tasks. Generally I just kind of flit from task to task until it is done with no major plan or framework for accomplishment and celebration. It's not worked great in the past. Then again, I've not taken on this degree of academic challenge in many years. Maybe if my methods are a little more in tune with my natural propensities I would be more inclined to adapt them to the point of habit. So, for that reason, I'm pretty pumped about that. 

I will move forward in this manner:

I will begin my day with a yoga routine and quick mindfulness meditation. Following that (and maybe breakfast) I will do a self-reflective journal entry, then go over tasks to accomplish. From there, it is important for me to take frequent breaks of review on what's happened so far and allow flow to arise organically. It will also be important for me during Phase 0 to isolate and insulate myself from distractions, but so far I feel confident that what I am doing is working fine. With some tweaking to optimize how this isolated time is spent I feel I can really maximize the productivity in the weeks to come. 

# The Command Line


1. A shell is a user interface. Bash stands for the specific one we will be using, "Bourne Again Shell." 
2. The most challenging part of this lesson for me was attempting the "Do More" exercises. I had the opportunity to be exposed to things that I don't understand during that part. 
3. I was able to successfully implement each command, but honestly I don't feel like I retained the parts about environmental variables. I will revisit them later.
4. In my opinion, pwd, ls, cd and cd ../, touch, and less are probably the most useful for basic navigation.
5. Yes.
pwd - print working directory
ls - list directory
mv - move directory
cd - change directory (down - like further into a file)
../ - change directory (up - like closer to the Home or Desktop folders)
touch - creates an empty file
mkdir - makes a new directory
less - allows you to read and page through a file
rmdir - remove directory
rm - used for removing files
help - lists a bunch of commands

# Forking and Cloning

To create a new repo in Github, navigate to your personal page and hit the plus button on the top right. Select "New Repository" from the dropdown menu, and then fill out the next page with the name of your new repo and determine wether it will be public or private as well as if it will have a built in README file.


To fork from an existing repo, navigate to the source and hit the fork button on the top right. You might have to select your github username from a list of other users connected to the repo, but other than that, it really is that easy.


To clone a repo, you have to first make sure that you are able to access your Github account from your command line. Then you have to use the git clone COPY-OF-LINK-HERE command to get the info onto your machine.


You would fork a repo for many reasons. First off, it's easier and faster than trying to recreate it from scratch. Secondly, since forking makes a special version for you and leaves the original alone, it is a non-destructive method of working. If you screw up really bad and can't seem to fix it, you can always delete and go back to the original source for a fresh start.

I struggled deleting and re-cloning after the initial clone. I had to look up a command for deleting directories with files already in them (I came up with rmdir -rf dirname). That feels like a pretty useful and time-saving command to memorize.
