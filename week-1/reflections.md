# Think About Time


I was especially interested in learning about methods of creating new habits and the counter-intuitive ways of increasing productivity. As a right brained individual GTD and other methods of increasing productivity have never really spoken to me, so the habits and counter-intuitive methods were interesting to learn about. Timeboxing is an approach to working on a project that argues that you set a strict time limit (like the pomodoro technique) and then you simply stop wether you deem the project complete or not at that point. I think the idea would then be to reflect upon the experience to improve the next attempt. Like,"Did I finish?," or, "What did I learn about planning (or distractions, or whatever) from this instance of timeboxing?"

I feel like these resources were perfect for me to take an interest in because I freely admit that one of my greatest obstacles is a tendency to shirk organizational tasks. Generally I just kind of flit from task to task until it is done with no major plan or framework for accomplishment and celebration. It's not worked great in the past. Then again, I've not taken on this degree of academic challenge in many years. Maybe if my methods are a little more in tune with my natural propensities I would be more inclined to adapt them to the point of habit. So, for that reason, I'm pretty pumped about that. 

I will move forward in this manner:

I will begin my day with a yoga routine and quick mindfulness meditation. Following that (and maybe breakfast) I will do a self-reflective journal entry, then go over tasks to accomplish. From there, it is important for me to take frequent breaks of review on what's happened so far and allow flow to arise organically. It will also be important for me during Phase 0 to isolate and insulate myself from distractions, but so far I feel confident that what I am doing is working fine. With some tweaking to optimize how this isolated time is spent I feel I can really maximize the productivity in the weeks to come. 

# The Command Line


1. A shell is a user interface. Bash stands for the specific one we will be using, "Bourne Again Shell." 
2. The most challenging part of this lesson for me was attempting the "Do More" exercises. I had the opportunity to be exposed to things that I don't understand during that part. 
3. I was able to successfully implement each command, but honestly I don't feel like I retained the parts about environmental variables. I will revisit them later.
4. In my opinion, pwd, ls, cd and cd ../, touch, and less are probably the most useful for basic navigation.
5. Yes.
pwd - print working directory
ls - list directory
mv - move directory
cd - change directory (down - like further into a file)
../ - change directory (up - like closer to the Home or Desktop folders)
touch - creates an empty file
mkdir - makes a new directory
less - allows you to read and page through a file
rmdir - remove directory
rm - used for removing files
help - lists a bunch of commands
