#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

You create a repository online at Github by clicking the plus on the top right and following the instructions. Then you have to get your computer to talk to it to see that a new repository has been made. This process involves copying the link provided once you created your new repository and pasting it into a bit of code that creates a direct line of communication from your computer to the files online in your new repository. 

#Describe what open source means.

Open source basically means the source code is free to the public. Free to contribute towards or modify, but also you don't have to pay for it. 

#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think the ability to work on one project with hundreds or thousands of people with nothing but a bit of technology and an internet connection sounds like black magic. It's like the ultimate culmination of the potential of the internet. What is the internet for? Cat videos and facebook? I don't think so. It's for working on meaningful projects that impact people around the world in a very real and tangible way. So yeah, an online utopia. 

#Assess the importance of using licenses.

The licensing can not only provide an automatic copyright in the U.S. but it lets others know the intended use of the repo

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The main takeaway for me on this particular challenge was just how to use Git and Github effectively. I had several "aha" moments during exercise 1.5 just wrapping my head around the importance of doing things in the correct order. I struggled some putting the order together in my head, but again, just doing it a couple of times seemed to clear that right up.
