#What does puts do?

Puts simply displays a string

#What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers, and a float is any number with a decimal point

#What is the difference between float and integer division? 

Float division will return a number with a decimal value, integer division will always round down. For instance, in 'Learn to program' the example is 9/2. Float division will return 4.5, integer will return 4.

#How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

I would say that float division takes into account remainders and finishes the math, but integer division just finds the largest whole number.
