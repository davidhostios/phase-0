<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I found the whole process as fun as it was illuminating. Being able to pair with someone really forces you to grind 
until you can come up with the solution because you want to
be able to help your partner. It also helps you talk through
a solution, like,"Ok, did we use the correct syntax?" and 
"Were you on the right branch?" when encountering a 
problem. We were able to figure out why our image wasn't 
displaying properly with just a few minutes of research and 
experiment. 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Pretty straight-forward. It's easy to remember the tags like 
it's easy to remember what "no" translates to in Spanish. Img 
means image, head means head, title means title. It's easy to 
remember the odd men out because most of them are the rule 
and not the exception.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no 
formatting in the HTML)
We did resize (ever-so-slightly) the geico logo image. It was 
hard not to because the size just didn't look right.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems like a great way to simply add in the elements
of a web site. I've heard the metaphor that HTML is he bones
of a project and I think that holds up. It would be super 
difficult to get any kind of elegant solution out of just HTML
because it is so hard to stylize everything. You'd have to do 
each element individually, and that alone could add up quick. 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
One of the most useful tricks I employ is to write the 
closing tags when I write the opening tags. I think that
is good practice to establish
the hierarchy of what lives inside of what and what parts get 
some kind of attribute, etc. early on.
