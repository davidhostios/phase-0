markup language used to structure web pages
interpreted by browser
semantics - HTML elements have meaning associated with them, and their placement and structure within the page further leverages this meaning.

html5boilerplate.com - great starting place for every new HTML - you can pull it straight off Github

*meta, link, img tags have no closing tags

comments in html 
<!-- This is a comment! --> 
Note the above syntax

HTML created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the WWW for CERN reasearchers as well as both the browser and server technology - originally had only 18 tags - no audio/video/images 

--Modern HTML
-100+ tags, some self-closing
-Variety of required and optional atributes
-Support for stylesheet languages
-support for advanced media objects
-ability to store arbitrary data
-advanced form capabilities - filling out forms 
-enhanced semantics via new HTML5 tags and attributes

twitter, for example, has about 8000 lines of code for a regular page

** attributes in sublime show up lime green
<a href="www.google.com"></a>
<img src="self-closing tag of an image">

to understand HTML, think about 

#1 - structure - a tree of nested nodes (tags)
#2 - tags themselves - familiarizing yourself with them
#3 - attributes - both concepts and examples
required to hareness the power of HTML

Other Considerations :
-CSS
-accessibility (visible v. audible websites)
-Cross-browser support and limitations - tricky tricky
-Form design and implemenation
-Mobile and responsive design
-HTML5 and CSS3 features and capabilities

Design stuffs

1.plan (at least a little bit)
--intent--
--content--
get an idea of what info you want out there/different ways to display that shit
think about what content in first and what will be secondary
--CREATE A SITEMAP--
looks like a chart that shows each part you want to display
--sketching--
just a way to visualize - often done on a whiteboard
--wireframes--
make it clear that this is not the final design - balsamiq.com - just how the pages flow together

--establish hierarchy--
how important are the elements? 

"hierarchy is also about storytelling; it's about our user's jorney through the website and the user flow we create" -Rachel Shillcock

on emotional colors check out tuts.com -maybe - 
colour lovers - predetermined colors with hex values
color hex - pick out your own colors and provides you with more
kuler - awesome one from adobe - you can even import a pic and get info
paletton

google fonts
typecast - helps you pick
size/contrast/space
contrast ratio

Modular scale
said to increase legibility/readability
applies common ratios 

trust your eyes

responsive type - for making sure everything works no matter the size of he screen

imagery - stock images - consider licensing

always think back to tone and intent

#2 - Iterate
what minimum amount of features make this a working product?
keeps you from rabbit hole

--USE THE INSPECTOR!--
important - doing the changes in the browser inspector before you add to your code WORKS WAY BETTER - it even has an emulator to tell you how things would look on different devices

--FRAMEWORKS--
include from beginning
additional style sheets will customize further

cheat sheet on responsive web design - find it
relative units - use them - automatically scales in response to different sizes of mobile devices etc
