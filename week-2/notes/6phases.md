## Phase One: Information gathering

It is absolutely integral to success that a designer have 'a solid understanding of the company it is created for.' Business goals and dreams, and how the web can work toward that end. WHATS THE POINT? Other things to consider include:

-Purpose
What is the purpose of the site? Provide info, promotion, sales, etc

-Goals
What do you want to accomplish? Is it possible to be specific?
$, Dist Info, etc

-Target Audience
Profile a theoreical individual that is your perfect demogaphic. What concerns and needs does this group have?

-Content
What info will your target audience want? Can you be specific?

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase Two: Planning

-Site Mapping

Planning the necessary components, elements, and features a site will need.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase Three: Design

-prototype
-Communication is crucial
-could be just a .jpg, could be a secure location to perouse

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase Four: Development

Coding! Yay! 

Create a home page, then work onto a "shell" as the template of the interior pages.

Do you need a CMS? Shopping Carts? Functional things here

HTML/CSS inserted here for the next phase...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase Five: Testing and Delivery

Web Designer takes over to test overall functionality and compatibility to different broswers across different devices (thus sizes) 

Make sure all code Validates

SEO - Search Engine Optimization - More details on that later

This marks the official launch of your site

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Phase Six: Maintenance

New content etc. - often a designer  will offer maintenance packages at reduced rates, based on how often you anticipate making changes or additions. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Takeaway

Communicate at each step of the process. Break down the tasks into smaller tasks. If you don't get along with the people you are building for (or with) you're gonna have a bad time.
