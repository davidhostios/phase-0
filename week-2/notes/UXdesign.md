## What is User Experience?

Abbreviated UX, it is how someone feels about a system, generally denoted by some form of human-computer interaction (HCI).
A system could be any kind of website, application, desktop software, etc.

A UX Designer studies and evaluates the overall EXPERIENCE of using a piece of technology that requires us to write code. 

UX Design developed by some hotshot with two first names named Dr. Donald Norman. Previous to the concept of UX Design, designers worked on just two things: what was awesome and what the client wanted to see. (I've worked enough retail to know that the customer is often clueless)

Importance of accessibilty - not just for new devices, but outdated ones also.

The driving factor of how we build websites today has become the experience we want to give the people who will use the websites.

## What Situations would benefit most from UX Design?

-Complex systems
multi-faceted websites, interaction-rich Web applications and e-commerce websites.
Must be perceived as being valuable, pleasant, and efficient 

-Start-ups
sound pretty awful. you may have to do two people's worth of work or not get paid much

-Projects with "OK" budgets
The focus here may shift more towards building and less on planning, research, and analysis

-Projects with longer timeframes
I don't know - here's what is says
"By simple logic, adding a cog to the traditional website production process will extend the timeline. Time must be allotted for user experience design. UX designers could, in theory, shorten timelines by taking on some of the tasks traditionally assigned to Web designers and developers, thus potentially saving time and costs in revision phases by having addressed user issues."
Not sure I see the relevance
