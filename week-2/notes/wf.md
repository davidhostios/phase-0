# Wireframing
While a Site Map can help you come up with the ideas that you need to include, etc., a WIREFRAME is the page composition of the design process. Pragmatic things like hierarchy are considerations in any compositional design process, but for the purpose of wireframing, the solution basically needs to stick to the elements and not include much stylization or color. 
####If the solution doesn't work in black and white, it doesn't work at all. 

##Steps for Wireframing
####While there is no one way to do a wireframe when setting up for a project, this is the general process

#Step 1 - Getting Inspiration
Check out what a good wireframe for your type of project (or several) looks like. Keep an eye out for what really works as well as wha you don't like. 

----------------------------------------------------------
##Notes on the design process - what really works

###1. Collecting Information
-Meet with the client - identify the product's requirements
- Benchmarking and trend analysis
-Field studies and task analysis **hardly used**

###2.Getting Ready to Design
-Almost always done with paper - quick and dirty. This stage is not about documenting, it's about aristic fury and creative explosion. 
-May include Adaptive Path's multipage templates.
-Not used often are lo-fi prototypes. Many begin making creative choices based on just the sketches. 

###3. Design
-Most used wireframing or prototyping
-Most did not delve into Hi-fi design. 
-Most get an expert review backed up with cognitive walkthrough

###4. Approval
-Story-telling improves the acceptability when presenting your project for approval
-usability studies generally not used
-Solution: guerilla research - look up specifically what that means

### Recurring Issues
#####1. Spreading an understanding of the design process
If everyone is not on the same page as far as the development of creative solutions, then you can have misunderstandings about what the final product should be. 
######2. Communication 
This applies to life. No just listening but implementing the ideas of others.
######3. Demonstrating the process to get buy-in
How do you sell your vision of the project to the client, both formally and psychologically?
