# What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design are as follows:

## 1. Information Gathering 
Perhaps the most important step of building for the web, this stage includes really nailing down the purpose, goals, target audience, and content that you will include. Research is an integral part of this process. 

## 2 . Planning
Ok, you've thought about the ideas you want to convey and the goals and purpose of your site, now we think about how to accomplish these goals. Answering some more questions for yourself can help crystallize a vision of the final product. What elements/features/pages need to be included? Creating a Site Map can be a helpful tool during this process. A Site Map is basically a flowchart that helps you determine which pages you'll need and what to include in each part. Base your flowchart on the information gathered in the previous step. 

## 3 . Design
During the design process, you will need to create some type of prototype, wether it be a simple image of what the final design will look like or a secure area of the web site meant for customers to view a work in progress. 

Communication with the site designer (if it's not you already) and the client is crucial during this stage to ensure that the final product is serving the purpose and needs intended.

## 4 . Development
Coding time, baby! Graphic elements, HTML/CSS, contact forms, the nuts and bolts of what will comprise the site all are put together here. Again, constant communication is key for this phase of development. (I'm detecting a theme here - and this goes for life, not just coding...Effective Communication is crucial for success)

## 5 . Testing and Delivery
So you built a web site. Big whoop, wanna fight about it? This is the part where you attend to the final details and test your web site. You'll need to make sure all the code validates and that it works across different sized devices and different browsers. 

Considerations such as SEO (Search Engine Optimization) should be included in this phase, because no one will view a page they can't find!

It may also be a good idea to test for site performance, run an A/B test to determine how well your site works, or put together a poll for user input.  

# 6 . Maintenance
Obviously, at some point you may want to add more or update existing content. Often a designer  will offer maintenance packages at reduced rates, based on how often you anticipate making changes or additions.

# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The goal of my site is shameless self-promotion. I need to make a name for myself in the field and what better way to show my skills than a great site? 

I will need to include a link to my tech blog, examples of my work as they are made available, contact forms and possibly an email list for users to receive updates, social media links, pictures, and a bio. 

# What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Well, I think first off, who is the target audience? The most useful demographic for me would be hiring-manager types - maybe around my age or older, so 25-45. Educated, growth-mindset, artistic, technical expertise, and in my estimation, a somewhat off-color sense of humor. 

What I can really nail down is this - the person I want looking at my site is a developer, and thus probably living in an urban area (big city folks). They are probably going to be from 25-45 years old. 

Here's a good list of general things to think about:
-Age
-Location
-Gender
-Income
-Education
-Occupation
-Ethnicity
-Marital Status
-Number of children

Good resources in this area include:

-Followerwonk (no clue - learn 'local language' of people within industry)

# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

My main goal is to get an awesome job, so I need the people that visit my site to read about who I am to understand if I'll be a good fit for their professional environment, and also to look at examples of my code to understand that I am capable of doing the work. Then I need to be available to be reached.

# What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
You want the website to be perceived as valuable, pleasant, and efficient. Make it easy for a person to navigate the site and get your point across simply. For a special emphasis on pleasant, choose colors that somehow fit the theme of the site (different strokes for different folks on that one). 

# What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
UX Design is a professional discipline that addresses how a user feels when they interact with a piece of technology. Is the user finding it easy to navigate and do what they want, or is it cumbersome and ineffective? Bad UX design (or lack altogether) would result in the latter. Does it work, but look terrible? Does it perform quickly or do you have to wait for each page to agonizingly load?

UX Design is a structured approach that attempts to answer these questions and more. One thing I found interesting about UX Design (which I did not anticipate) is that it is not directly measurable by usual means. How do you measure happy?
This leads to UX Designers using creative methods of measurement and optimization like polls, A/B tests, and (in some cases) seeing how much income has been generated.

# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I'm still getting used to submitting work through git, so I'd say that would have to be the most tedious part, but probably the most useful to attack my weaknesses.
